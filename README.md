Create Katamari levels using level data from the d04.dat from Beautiful Katamari. Copy and paste the level data from after <loc> and before </loc> for your desired location into a new .dat and open it with the editor. 

Still pretty buggy, but few crashes.

Also very useful to have the CSV for all entity names and information.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B1yECjHLdb3jmblvio91jWOFhUgA3es-iXxWQYR7Syg/edit?gid=0#gid=0 


Putting an entity that doesn't usually exist in the level usually crashes the game.

Also a d04 injector so you don't have to manually edit your .dat file
