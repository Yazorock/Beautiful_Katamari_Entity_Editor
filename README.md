Create Katamari levels using level data from the d04.dat from Beautiful Katamari. Copy and paste the level data from after <loc> and before </loc> for your desired location into a new .dat and open it with the editor. 

Still pretty buggy, but few crashes.

Also very useful to have the CSV for all entity names and information.

Putting an entity that doesn't usually exist in the level usually crashes the game.
